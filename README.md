# Django Craiglist WebScraping with Clever Programmer
This project was created for following the YouTube video [Python Django Tutorial 2020 - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT80XhYJdBw&list=PLlqAFin4VJ52ep7lwqYTURmvyu_OD_Z-k&index=3&t=13707s) (from part 7), focused only on craiglist webscraping for studying purposes. The idea is follow the video exactly as they do, but in my case the project setup was created with pipenv and not with anaconda, and then after improve with my own contributions that I'll list in [ideas_for_improvements.md](./ideas_for_improvements.md) file.

## Project dependencies
To get dependencies intallations easy, it was used the pipenv with a newer Python and Django versions than are used in the tutorial. Therefore, **ensure that you have pipenv installed in your machine** and, before everything, install all project dependencies with the following commands line `pipenv shell` and then `pipenv install`.

## Run locally
Everytime you need to run it locally, remember to activate the virtual environment with the following command line `pipenv shell` and then, considering that you are at the same directory of manage.py file, run the command line `python manage.py runserver` or if you prefer, just type `./manage.py runserver`.
